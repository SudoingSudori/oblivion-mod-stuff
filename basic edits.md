This is a note on basic property changes for the remaster. Might be useful if you just need to do small changes like weight/cost/enchantments. Don't change names using this method, as AltarESPMain.esp changes all the names in the game to be localization strings that are managed by UE5 side.

# Instructions
1. Install the latest xEdit (4.1.5n as of this guide) from [their Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5t8RnNQ). Installation folder does not matter, as long as you don't lose it.
2. Boot up xEdit with next arguments:
   `xEdit.exe -TES4R -D:"C:\path\to\OblivionRemastered\Content\Dev\ObvData\Data\" -I:"C:\path\to\OblivionRemastered\Content\Dev\ObvData\Oblivion.ini"`
   -D is the location of Data folder, -I is the location of Oblivion.ini, -TES4R - makes xEdit aware it's remaster.
3. Load Oblivion.esm and all the DLC files.
