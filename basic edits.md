This is a note on basic property changes for the remaster.

# Instructions
1. Install the [Oblivion Construction Set]( https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Construction_Set#The_Construction_Set_v1.2). Follow [this guide](https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13513548-installing-oblivion-construction-set-for-oblivion-remastered/), for example.
2. Open the AltarMainESP.esp in the Construction Set; don't make it active.
3. Do the whatever property changes you need (don't change the item names or it'll break localization)
4. Save the new esp file, double check it's in the ObvData/Data folder (look at the guide above)
5. Find plugins.txt in ObvData/Data folder and add your mod name to the end.
6. Try to load in and look for changes.
